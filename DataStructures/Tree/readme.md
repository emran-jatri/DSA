# Tree Data Structure

- A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
- Node: A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes
- Leaf Node: The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes
- Internal Node: The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.
- Root Node: It is the topmost node of a tree
- Edge: It is the link between any two nodes
