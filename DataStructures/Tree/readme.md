# Tree Data Structure

- **Tree:** A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
- **Node:** A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes
- **Leaf Node:** The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes
- **Internal Node:** The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.
- **Root Node:** It is the topmost node of a tree
- **Edge:** It is the link between any two nodes
- **Height of a node:**  The height of a node is **the number of edges** from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node)
- **Depth of a Node:** The depth of a node is the **number of edges** from the root to the node.
- **Height of a Tree:** The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.
