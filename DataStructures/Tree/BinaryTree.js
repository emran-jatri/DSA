/* 

- A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children. Each node of a binary tree consists of three items:
- data item
- address of left child
- address of right child

1. Full Binary Tree: every parent node/internal node has either two or no children
2. Perfect Binary Tree: every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level
3. Complete Binary Tree: 
- A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences
- Every level must be completely filled
- All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
- The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.
