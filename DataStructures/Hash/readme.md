# Hash
- The Hash table data structure stores elements in key-value pairs where
- Key- unique integer that is used for indexing the values
- Value - data that are associated with keys.

# Hash Collision
- When the hash function generates the same index for multiple keys, there will be a conflict (what value to be stored in that index). This is called a hash collision.

- We can resolve the hash collision using one of the following techniques.
